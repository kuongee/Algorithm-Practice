# Maximum Subsequence Sum with Dynamic Programming

> Find Maximum subsequence sum

-  Brute Force 

    * Evaluate every subsequences

    * O(n^3)

- Dynamic Programming

    * It finishes in just O(n).

My Code: MaxSum.java

If current sum of subsequence becomes under zero, then just start new subsequence.
