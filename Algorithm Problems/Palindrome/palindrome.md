I implemented the program in two ways. 

1. Iteration

2. Recursion

Acutally, I wanted to compare the execution time of those ways. (However, there are no big difference between each execution time up to 10,000 letters.)

The recursion implementation(0.209s) is 100x slower than iteration implementation(0.001s) when the number of letters is 12,000.
