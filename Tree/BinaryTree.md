## Binary Tree

Binary tree is a tree structure that each node has maximum 2 child nodes.

```
Ex)
    A
  /   \
 B     C
```

* Traversal Algorithm

  - DFS (Depth First Search)

    Implement as recursion

    1. Preorder
      
      A B C
    
    2. Inorder
    
      B A C
    
    3. Postorder

      B C A

  - BFS (Breadth First Search) (or Level order traversal)
