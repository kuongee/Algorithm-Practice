## Binary Heap

Heap is a data structure based on complete binary tree.

```
Ex)
          Root
        /      \
       A        B
      / \      / 
     C   D    E   
```

#### - Min heap

The value of Root is smallest value.

The value of each node must smaller than its child nodes.

#### - Max heap

The value of Root is the maximum value.

The value of each node must larger than its child nodes.
