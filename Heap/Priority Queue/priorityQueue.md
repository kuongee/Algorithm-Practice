## Priority Queue

Priority Queue can be implemented with heap.

This queue extracts the element that is the highest priority.

In Java, priority queue is built-in implementation. --> This is easier to program.

I used array and sorted every time when the new element comes in in problem BoJ 10814.

This is very bad idea because of time complexity.
